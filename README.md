Netflix Data Science Midterm Project

## Project Team: 
Gaston Shefa, Jessica Camacho, Neco Hinton, Thomas Ye

## Data Set:
Our data set used was created by Dr. Patalano and Dr. Heubner. It is based on a fictious organization and is used to teach other students how to analyze and understand HR data. More about the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set?select=HRDataset_v14.csv

## Our Main Questions:
1. How does marital status affect performance?
2. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?

## Our Process Steps:
1. We imported all the necessary libraries and files including pandas, matplotlib, and the dataset.
2. For Question 1, we grouped performance by marital status using a bar graph. We used these fields: MaritalDesc, Performance Score
3. For Question 1, we grouped performance by marital status using a bar graph. We used these fields: MarriedID, Performance Score
4. For Question 2, we first looked at the overall racial and gender profiles of the organization. We focused on gender and made a bar chart using these fields: Sex, Department
5. For Question 2, we also looked at the gender profile by department. We created a bar graph. We used these fields: Department, Sex

## The Solution
By performing these additional analyses, we will be able to understand the workforce population and help employers adopt better hiring/retention strategies.

## Summary Findings
- This company should hire more unmarried employees. They tend to perform better at the higher end.
- The overall gender diversity of the organization needs to be considered first before diving into the departmental levels.

## Future Questions to Explore
1. Do departments differ in average performance?
2. Does gender play a role in performance?
3. Do certain departments have more unmarried employees?
