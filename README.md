## Our Main Questions:
1. How does marital status affect performance?
2. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?

## Our Process Steps:
1. We imported all the necessary libraries and files including pandas, matplotlib, and the dataset.
2. For Question 1, we grouped performance by marital status using a bar graph. We used these fields: 
    o   MaritalDesc 
    o   Performance Score
3. For Question 2, we first looked at the overall racial profiles of the organization by making a bar graph that grouped races by hispanic/latino identifiers. We used these fields:
    o    HispanicLatino
    o   RaceDesc
4. For Question 2, we also looked at the gender profile by department. We created a bar graph. We used these fields:
    o    Department
    o   Sex
5. For Question 2, we first looked at the gender profile by recruitment sources using a bar graph. We created a bar graph. We used these fields:
    o   Sex 
    o   Recruitment Source

## The Solution
By performing these additional analyses, we will be able to understand the workforce population and help employers adopt better hiring/retention strategies.
